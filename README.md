Hi! It's Great to have you here.

I'm a software developer trying to not only make things work, but doing it in the right way. I'm currently focused in distributed systems and golang. I think that to become lay-off-proof you need to understand things (not only computer things) deeply, I'm not there yet but i'm on track. Talk to me about any computer-related (just don't try to make me use Windows). I never get tired :)
